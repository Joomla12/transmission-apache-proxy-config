# transmission-apache-proxy-config
This configuration is for proxying Transmission Daemon over a subdomain with Apache. I'm more or less creating this repository for personal use, however someone may come across it and find it useful. This configuration also resolves the 405 and 409 proxy and RPC errors respectively.
